## 📋 Project Overview

### **Problem Statement**
UTM bus users experience frustration due to:
- **Unpredictable waiting times** (90.9% of users)
- **Lack of real-time information** (72.7% of users)
- **Difficulty navigating routes** (72.7% of users)
- **Overcrowding during peak hours** (45.5% of users)

### **Our Solution**
A Modern UTM Bus Navigation System featuring:
- **Real-time GPS tracking** of all campus buses
- **Accurate arrival predictions** with countdown timers
- **Interactive route maps** with color-coded systems
- **Personalized notifications** for delays and arrivals
- **Accessibility features** for diverse user needs

### **Key Statistics**
- **22 users surveyed** across students, staff, and visitors
- **100% demand** for real-time tracking features
- **90% task completion rate** during usability testing
- **85% reduction** in user-reported waiting anxiety

## 🎯 Design Thinking Process

### **1. Empathy Phase**
- Conducted interviews with 13 users at bus stops
- Created personas: **Ali** (Student) and **Mr. Lee** (Visitor)
- Observed user behavior during peak hours
- Documented emotional pain points and frustrations

### **2. Define Phase**
- Synthesized research using affinity mapping
- Identified 5 core problem areas
- Developed "How Might We" questions for ideation
- Created clear problem statements for each user segment

### **3. Ideate Phase**
- Brainstormed 15+ potential solutions
- Evaluated ideas based on feasibility and impact
- Selected top 3 solutions through team voting
- Used AI assistance for idea expansion and refinement

### **4. Prototype Phase**
- Developed 3 iterative versions in Figma
- Added features based on user feedback
- Created high-fidelity interactive prototype
- Implemented accessibility and customization options

### **5. Test Phase**
- Conducted usability tests at Center Point bus stop
- Collected feedback through observation and surveys
- Iterated designs based on user suggestions
- Validated solution effectiveness with target users
